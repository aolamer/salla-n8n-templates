## üìÅ Available Templates

### 1. Salla to Supabase Integration (`n8n-supabase/`)

**Template**: `salla-supabase-n8n-template.json`

This template provides a complete workflow for synchronizing Salla store data with a Supabase database. It captures order events from Salla webhooks and automatically stores them in structured database tables.

#### Features:
- **Real-time Order Processing**: Captures `order.created` events from Salla webhooks
- **Data Transformation**: Converts Salla order JSON to Supabase-compatible records
- **Multi-table Support**: Handles customers, orders, and order line items
- **Event Routing**: Intelligent routing based on event types
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity during transformation

#### Workflow Components:
1. **Salla Trigger**: Receives webhook events from Salla
2. **Event Routing**: Routes different event types to appropriate handlers
3. **Order Data Processing**: Transforms Salla order data to database format
4. **Route by Data Type**: Separates customer, order, and order line data
5. **Database Operations**:
   - Customer upsert (create or update)
   - Order insertion
   - Order line items insertion

#### Database Schema Requirements:
The template expects the following Supabase tables:

- **customers**: Store customer information
- **orders**: Store order details
- **order_lines**: Store individual order line items

#### Configuration Required:
- Salla OAuth2 credentials
- Supabase API credentials
- Webhook secret configuration
- Store ID mapping in the data processing code

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (self-hosted)
- Salla store with API access
- Target service credentials (e.g., Supabase account)

### Steps
1. **Download Template**: Download the desired template JSON file
2. **Import to n8n**: In your n8n instance, go to Workflows ‚Üí Import from File
3. **Configure Credentials**: Set up the required credentials for each service
4. **Customize Mapping**: Modify data transformation logic as needed
5. **Test Workflow**: Use the built-in test data or create test webhooks
6. **Activate**: Enable the workflow to start processing live data

## üîß Customization
